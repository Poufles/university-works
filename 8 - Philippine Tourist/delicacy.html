                        <p>
                            A traditional Filipino chicken dish with a unique preparation method that involves beating the live chicken before cooking it. This practice is believed to enhance the flavor and texture of the meat, giving it a distinctive smoky taste. The dish is typically made using native or free-range chicken, which is prized for its robust flavor and firm texture.

                                <li>
                                    Start by preparing the chicken, cleaning it thoroughly inside and out. You can keep it whole or cut it into smaller pieces according to your preference.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Rub the chicken with salt inside and out. Let it sit for about 30 minutes to allow the salt to penetrate the meat.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    In a large pot, add the chicken, crushed garlic, sliced ginger, onion, green chili peppers (if using), and enough water to completely cover the chicken.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer over low heat for about 30 minutes to 1 hour, depending on the size of the chicken, until it is fully cooked and the meat easily falls off the bones.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    During cooking, regularly skim off any impurities that rise to the surface.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Once the chicken is cooked, remove it from the pot and let it cool slightly.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Meanwhile, add the vegetables of your choice to the pot and simmer until tender.

                                <li>
                                    Once the chicken has cooled, use your hands to shred the meat into coarse pieces.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Return the shredded chicken to the pot with the vegetables, then add the vinegar. Season with black peppercorns and bay leaves, if desired.

                                <li>
                                    Let simmer for a few more minutes to allow the flavors to meld.

                            A traditional blood sausage originating from the mountainous Cordillera region in the Philippines. It is prepared using either pork or chicken blood mixed with lean pork meat, chopped offal (such as liver or heart), garlic, onions, salt, and pepper. This mixture is then stuffed into pork intestines and boiled until cooked through.

                        <h3>KINIWAR</h3>
                        <p>
                            A delicious traditional Filipino dessert. It is made by cooking glutinous rice with coconut milk and sugar until it becomes sticky and caramelized. The mixture is then typically placed in a banana leaf-lined pan and topped with latik, which is a sweet coconut milk residue. The dish is then baked or steamed until the flavors meld together and the top becomes golden brown. Kiniwar/Biko is loved for its sweet, rich flavor and chewy texture, making it a favorite dessert during celebrations and gatherings in the Philippines.

                                    The Etag Festival traces its roots back to the indigenous communities of the Cordillera region in the Philippines, where it has been celebrated for generations as a symbol of cultural identity and heritage. The festival's origins can be traced to the traditional practice of preserving meat through drying, a method that has been passed down through the ages as a way to ensure food security and sustainability in the mountainous terrain.

                                    Historically, the Etag Festival served as a time for communities to come together and celebrate successful harvests, express gratitude to the spirits of the land, and honor their ancestors for their blessings. It was also an opportunity for people to showcase their culinary skills and creativity, as they prepared and shared their prized Etag delicacies with friends, family, and visitors.
                                    Over the years, the Etag Festival has evolved into a vibrant cultural celebration, featuring a wide array of activities and events that highlight the unique traditions and customs of the Cordillera people. From colorful parades and traditional dances to music performances and culinary showcases, the festival offers a diverse and immersive experience for participants and spectators alike.

                                Pinikpikan is a traditional dish from the Cordillera region of the Philippines, renowned for its unique preparation method and distinctive flavor. The dish starts with a whole chicken, preferably native or free-range, which is carefully prepared for cooking. One of the key steps in pinikpikan's preparation is the ritualistic process known as "pikpik," where the chicken is gently beaten with a stick or blunt object. This practice is believed to tenderize the meat and enhance its flavor.

                                Kinilaw is a popular dish enjoyed by locals and visitors alike. Kinilaw is a traditional Filipino dish similar to ceviche, typically made with fresh raw fish or seafood marinated in vinegar, calamansi juice (a type of citrus fruit), onions, ginger, and chili peppers. The acidity from the vinegar and calamansi juice "cooks" the raw fish, giving it a tangy flavor while preserving its freshness.

                                Additionally, it is often prepared using locally sourced ingredients, such as fresh fish caught from nearby rivers or seas. The dish is usually served as an appetizer or as part of a larger meal, accompanied by rice or other side dishes. Some variations of kinilaw may include additional ingredients like coconut milk, cucumber, or tomatoes, adding complexity to the flavor profile.

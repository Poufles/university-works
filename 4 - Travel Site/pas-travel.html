                                    During our stay in the resort, my family had a great time since the wife's owner is my mom's cousin; being able to try different food offers, having a night cabine, and having swimming pool access. However, moving that aside, the resort was a great place to chill and connect with nature. I, personally, loved the ambiance it offers and the long walks you can take around the whole vicinity making you admire the nearby farmlands. Also, there is a band that plays every night if you wish to well profit from your stay. I do not really like this idea, especially it's already night time but it is fun to see the lights and hear the noise of people having fun.

                                    As seen on the right picture, those were me and my dad doing boat ride, which is an amusing and thrilling activity to do. Moreover, the open waters by the right side of the resort is well fitted for this activity since the view from the right provides a nice view of the whole resort and you can, somewhat, have a peaceful bonding with your companies. Although, I would not recommend doing this in broad daylight since the temparature is too hot.

                                A naturalistic beach offering a similar appearance to boracay, which is why it is also called as "Little Boracay". The beach offers a clear white sand with a shallow shore which is convenient for those who want to go beyond the beach. Rentable houses, cottages, and food businesses are also present for those who wish to stay.

                                This was actually a 2 family, 2 part trip since our uncle was celebrating his birthday. My first impressions of the beach were astonishing, lucid, and scenic. I was able to see a vast sea with mountains in the background including a forest with establishment in business. The sand were, in fact, white and clear making the water almost transparent. There were also some plant life near the shore, which were creepy at first since it tickles the feet and it made me think as if there were something beneath. I do remember laying on the shore being gently hit by the waves and feeling both cold and hot simultaneously, which was a weird feeling but I also felt peace. Moreover, it was a nice experience to relax after a long, hard, and tiring academic semester. It made me reflect about myself.

                                    Mediocre may it seem, a house is where everything starts. It is the nursery of the society that develops children to become competent adults through the guidance of their parents. Simultaneously, this is also the place where I feel at most tranquil and calm wherein I feel belonged and loved. The place where I learned how to become a better person through the care my family has instilled in me.

                                    I am the type of person who does not really explore the world and is commonly found at their home doing whatever it is that interests them. I like my alone time and my silence with the laughter and noise that those who I love make. Also, I feel free to be me and show who I am since no one judges my move or actions.

                            Being at home has this sentiment of peace that everyone perceive. It is due to the fact that we are in an enclosed space and a fort structure that protects us from the public life. The privacy it provides is precious and intact, which our inner self benifits from. Personally, only at our home I can feel like doing everything. The imagination runs free and my creativity shows its color which is, then, translated into my works. Moreover, the silence that I can attain even if my family is noisy is satisfying and just. In this context, silence signifies the ambiance of hearing your loved ones and their personal life, away from the problems of the world. Consequentially, the love and care of my family further deepen the peace that I perceive making me protected from any harm and assuring me that there is nothing to worry about.

                            The freedom of showing who you are with those people you loved is a great feeling to perceive. It creates this ambience; the aura, of natural communication without any pressure from the standards of the world. Being able to tell the thoughts in your mind to your family is not just a way of de-stressing, but also a way to bond profoundly. Consequentially, it provides a strengthen link between family members making each one open and welcoming to themselves and others. It is to note that the heart always aims to be free from any constraint since it ensures its healthiness and well-being. Therefore, being able to tell your problems without any worry from those around you releases the burden that it carries. Furthermore, having freedom to do anything at your place makes us more human since it is up to us what things we would love to add in order to make our home more lively, colorful, creative, and heart-welcoming.
